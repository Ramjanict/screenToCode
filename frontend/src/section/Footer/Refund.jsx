      SnipScript.ai, we aim to provide high-quality services for all users. Due

      period. 1.3. By completing a purchase, you acknowledge and agree to this
      policy. 2. Exceptions for Refunds 2.1. If a user experiences a technical
      issue that prevents access to SnipScript.ai services, and our support team

      accidental duplicate charge occurs, a refund will be issued upon
      verification. 2.3. Refund requests must be submitted within 7 days of the
